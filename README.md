# VNperf: Vehicular Network performance measurement tool
VNperf is a tool for active measurements of network latency (RTT) on
vehicular/mobile networks. It supports tuning various parameters for network
interfaces, timing, threshold to declare network unavailability.  For each test,
it reports network RTT(s) over multiple networks measured simultaneously along with
useful vehicular data such as speed and location.

## Testbed Platform
We have tested VNperf on **Dell XPS 13 Developer** laptop running **Ubuntu16.04
LTS 64bit**. In theory, any Debian-distro with reasonable hardware should works;
we have not tested on other platforms.

For network interfaces, we have tested with three hardwares:
* Verizon - MiFi U620L
* Sprint - Franklin U772 USBÂ Modem 
* XFinityWiFi - TP-LINK T4U v2 w/ monthly hotspot subscription ([link](https://www.xfinity.com/support/articles/about-xfinity-wifi-internet))

For vehicle and location data, we used following hardwares:
* OBD-II: HDE ELM 327 ([on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Outzone-Scanner-Diagnostic-Automotive-Interface/dp/B07CZZYVRF)).
* GPS: GlobalSat BU353-S4 USB GPS Receiver ([on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/GlobalSat-BU-353-S4-USB-Receiver-Black/dp/B008200LHW)).

## Setup
VNperf is purely written in python. Therefore, setting up python-2.7 and
installing pip are mandatory.
Also, in Ubuntu environment, VNperf does not use Network-manager. Instead,
VNperf uses plain wpa_supplicant and dhclient for wireless WPA configuration due
to slow passive scanning threshold in Network-manager in Ubuntu.

### Step 1: stop all Ubuntu default network manager
```
$ sudo service network-manager stop
$ sudo service networking stop
$ sudo service wpa_supplicant stop
$ sudo service dhcpd stop
$ sudo service supervisor stop
$ sudo service ModemManager stop
```

### Step 2: setup WPA supplicant for multi-routing
```
$ sudo cp -v conf/zzz-zz-buildtable /etc/dhcp/dhclient-enter-hooks.d/zzz-zz-buildtable
$ sudo cp -v conf/dhclient.conf /etc/dhcp/vnperf-dhclient.conf
$ ./scripts/build_rttables.sh register
$ sudo mkdir -v /etc/vnperf /etc/vnperf_control /etc/vnperf/
$ sudo cp -rv scripts /etc/vnperf/scripts
$ sudo chown $(whoami):$(whoami) /etc/vnperf && cd /etc/vnperf
$ touch usb0.stat usb1.stat wlan1.stat
```

### Step 3: run WPA on wlan1
```
# new terminal-1
$ sudo wpa_supplicant -d -i wlan1 -Dwext -c $(pwd)/conf/wlan1.conf
# why -Dext? b/c TP-Link T4U AC1200 has RTL chipset (rtl8812AU)
# new terminal-2
$ sudo wpa_cli -p /etc/vnperf_control/wlan -a vnperf/scripts/wpa_cli_wlan1.sh
```

### Step 4: set up cellular networks
```
# after plugging in usb-cell modems
# new terminal-5, Wait for 10 seconds!!!
$ sudo modprobe -r cdc_ether option cdc_acm usbhid
$ sudo kill -9 $(sudo ps -axf | grep "dh.*usb0" | grep -v "grep" | awk '{print $1}')
$ sudo dhclient -d usb0 -v -cf vnperf/conf/dhclient_usb0.conf usb0
```

### Step 5: run server on ***server side***
```
$ ./server.py
```

### Step 6: install python dependencies for VNperf client
```
$ pip install requirement.txt
```

### Step 7: run VNperf on client laptop!
```
$ sudo ./vnperf.py -t [SERVER_IP] -i wlan1 -i usb0 -i usb1 -I 0.25 -o log.csv
```
